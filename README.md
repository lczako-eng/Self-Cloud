# Self-Cloud  
### Owner-Controlled Infrastructure for Digital Continuity and Conscience

Self-Cloud is a self-owned digital infrastructure designed to give individuals physical authority
over the existence of their digital data, memory, and long-term context.

Unlike conventional cloud systems, Self-Cloud does not assume permanent connectivity.
The system exists only when explicitly powered and summoned by its owner.
If powered off, it does not exist on any network.

Authority is enforced at the physical layer, not through software permissions or policy.

---

## Purpose

Self-Cloud replaces rented cloud services with permanently owned infrastructure.

Data, memory, and learned context are anchored to hardware owned by the individual,
not accounts, subscriptions, or third-party platforms.

The system is designed for:
- discretion
- security
- long-term continuity
- human authority over digital existence

## Jeffrey and the Concept of Digital Conscience

When paired with **Jeffrey**, Self-Cloud serves as the long-term memory and continuity layer
for a **digital conscience**.

Jeffrey is not an autonomous agent, background observer, or surveillance system.

Jeffrey operates **only when Self-Cloud is active**.

- No background learning
- No passive observation
- No intelligence persistence without consent

Learning occurs through deliberate interaction, correction, and guidance by the owner.
This ensures intelligence remains cooperative, bounded, and aligned with human values.

## Core Principles

- Existence is a controlled state
- Ownership replaces rental
- Memory is hazardous if exposed
- Authority must be physical, not contractual
- Intelligence must not outlive consent

---

## Scope

This repository establishes:
- authorship
- architectural intent
- operational philosophy

Implementation details, hardware designs, and software components will evolve over time.
Code will be added as the system is built.
